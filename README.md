## How to Use





### Creating Diagrams

1. **Add Items**:
  - Press the "+" button on the top right menu, the library of components will appear on the left. Drag and drop components from the library onto the canvas
  - Or, perform a right click on the grid and select "Add node", you can then click on the new node you created and customise it from the left menu
2. **Connect Items**: Use connectors to show relationships between components
3. **Customize**: Change colors, labels, and properties of items
4. **Navigate**: Pan and zoom to work on different areas

### Saving Your Work

- **Auto-Save**: Diagrams are automatically saved to browser storage every 5 seconds
- **Quick Save**: Click "Quick Save (Session)" for instant saves without popups
- **Save As**: Use "Save New" to create a copy with a different name

### Managing Diagrams

- **Load**: Click "Load" to see all your saved diagrams
- **Import**: Load diagrams from JSON files shared by others
- **Export**: Download your diagrams as JSON files to share or backup
- **Storage**: Use "Storage Manager" to manage browser storage space

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Delete` - Remove selected items
- Mouse wheel - Zoom in/out
- Click and drag - Pan around canvas
- ***NEW*** Crtl+Z undo Ctrl+Y redo

## Building for Production

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Serve the production build locally
npx serve -s build
```

The build folder contains all files needed for deployment.

If you need the app to be deployed to a custom path (i.e. not root), use instead:
```bash
# Create optimized production build for given path
PUBLIC_URL="https://mydomain.tld/path/to/app" npm run build
```
That will add the defined `PUBLIC_URL` as a prefix to all links to static files.

## Deployment

### Static Hosting

Deploy the `build` folder to any static hosting service:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- AWS S3
- Any web server

### Important Notes

1. **HTTPS Required**: PWA features require HTTPS (except localhost)
2. **Browser Storage**: Diagrams are saved in browser localStorage (~5-10MB limit)
3. **Backup**: Regularly export important diagrams as JSON files

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (Recommended) ‚úÖ
- Firefox ‚úÖ
- Safari ‚úÖ
- Mobile browsers with PWA support ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

### Storage Full
- Use Storage Manager to free space
- Export and delete old diagrams
- Clear browser data (last resort - will delete all diagrams)

### Can't Install PWA
- Ensure using HTTPS
- Try Chrome or Edge browsers
- Check if already installed

### Lost Diagrams
- Check browser's localStorage
- Look for auto-saved versions
- Always export important work

## Technology Stack
